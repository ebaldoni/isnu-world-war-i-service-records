#ISNU World War I Service Records
This repository contains data related to the [World War I Illinois State University Service Records](https://cdm15990.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/WWI_records/search) digital collection.

##Raw Data
raw-collection-metadata.csv contains the raw, page-level, unprocessed metadata exported from the digital collection, including all transcripts (see the **Transcript** column).

##ArcGIS Data files
These are the data files used to create mapping visualizations in ArcGIS. They were derived from the raw colleciton metadata in raw.collection.metadata.csv and restructured (using OpenRefine) to create a dataset listing one-location-per-row. Because many individuals described by the collection traveled to multiple places, there may be multiple rows per person.
